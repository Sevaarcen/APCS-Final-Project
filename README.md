# Cole's code for AP Computer Science A final project

I wanted to upload what I did in High School to GitHub. This code is not best-practice (It isn't MVC, its using Swing, it has blocking IO for the music (lol)).

## Features
* A graphical interface
* Exciting boss battles
* Music
* Other stuff I forget because I made this two years ago
